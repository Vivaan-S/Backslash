## Introduction
Welcome to Backslash, a small side project that [Vivaan](https://youtube.com/channel/UCzuY7qNvGAfRqYdMJAxKb7g) and [Jeremiah](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/nwd4c4) started. It is a social media for developers to share ideas and projects. Our aim is to make a platform which helps people collaborate and help each other. We originally built Backslash as a medium for developers to connect and collaborate, but now it is easily usable by anybody.
Please help [improve this file](https://github.com/Vivaan-S/Backslash/edit/main/README.md).
